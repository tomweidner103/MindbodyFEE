Enjoy my project!

Please run npm install to get the packages I used

All styling was done with CSS, and the charts are using live(api) data!

The tabs are functional, although there are no components in them.

When the page loads, it loads the first three programs, and if you click the 'more' on the list of programs underneath it will expand those and update the state of the component. Enjoy!
